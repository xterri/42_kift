1. Start server with port number
	a. server is set up and listens for client connection
2. Client connects by server's ip address and port number
--
	3. Client sends a message
		a. To initialize / have server respond, client must says "hey baka" first
	4. Server hears "hey baka" and is ready to receive client's next message/command
		a. Have server respond to indicate that it acknowledges the client and is
			listening for their next command/request?
	5. Client sends command
	6. Server receives command and returns a response.
--
7. repeat steps 3 - 6 until client says "good bye baka" (all together?)
8. server acknowledge's client wish to end contact, responds
9. client receives the message and "terminates" connection


- server should still be "on" and ready to accept requests when client disconnects
